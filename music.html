    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my Music Page</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Freely explore my Music Collection</h2>

    <p>This page is a mirror of my musical creativity. It is a mixture of songs that I have
        written along with popular tunes from the American Songbook. I would like for this
        section of my website to also be a showcase for other artists as well, not that there
        would ever be any glory in it for the contributor, but more that it would be another
        way to share the fruits of one's creativity. For what value is there in music that is
        never listened to or books that will never be read. This is not be a place for recognition
        seekers. That is not what I am about or what my website is about.</p>
    
    <P>Below I have done my best to create a media source. This is one of those areas that has
        really baffled me as an amateur web designer. I haven't figured out how to create playlists
        and having them function as you would expect. If you are someone who has experience and 
        know how in this area, your advice would be greatly appreciated.</P>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">A Totally Free Internet</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Can It Be Achieved?</h2>

    <p>Glorious greetings to all visitors. Thank you for being here. I am somewhat new
        to hosting websites, so please understand that all of this is an ongoing project
        and is far from being finished. Therefore you will notice much of this website
        is not completed and probably never will be. To a certain extent this is intended
        due to the changing nature of what I would like to share, which could become vast
        in it's extent. It took sometime for me to sort out what my main goal was when
        creating this site. All I knew was, I wanted my very own place to communicate
        my thoughts, plus I was looking for and welcoming a new challenge.</p>

    <p>One of my goals in creating this site as well as in my life is to promote freedom.
        It has become all to clear to me that human nature causes all of us to choose a 
        path of least resistance, which makes a lot of sense in many ways, but can also
        limit our true potential. We like having things done for us. Then once we're
        accustomed to these conveiniences, they are no longer a privilege, but somthing we
        must have and demand that it be so. How many of us grow our own food, provide our
        own clothing and shelter? As humans we depend on one another to survive, but too
        often this need is taken advantage of by others for whatever greedy or intended
        purpose. Once human needs are exploited laws are created to make certain that
        those in power will always have the privilege of telling you how to behave. If 
        these laws are not obeyed you will certainly be punished and if possible publicly
        humiliated and condemned. I want to help change all of this or at the very least
        not allow it to grow any more than it already has.</p>

    <p>I remember back in the early days of the internet when people celebrated it's 
        open and unrestricted nature. Then slowly over time road blocks and restrictions
        were added to make the the web supposedly "more secure." These restrictions must
        be stopped and as much as possible erradicated. Eventually no one will be allowed
        access to the internet unless they are licensed, certified, and proven financially
        able to pay all of the required fees and do not have a "criminal background."</p> 

    <p>I would like to see an alternative internet, something like we had before the 
        police arrived. There should be an unrestricted internet with no rules -- enter
        at your own risk, an internet where there is no ownership, therefore, nothing 
        can be stolen or lost. I am not condemning the internet we have now and would like
        to see it continue and grow. I only want an alternative internet with absolutely
        no restrictions as to who and how it is made available.</p>
        
    <p>I would love for others to join me in a crusade for a free and open internet, as
        well as freedom in all other aspects of life. If you have any idea how a movement
        like this can be started, I would love to hear from you. Or perhaps something has
        already been started that I am not aware of and should be told about.</p>

    <P>Like everyone one else, I have those things in my life that I am passionate about
        and would like to share with others. I have made a list of some of those things.</P>

            <p>The above is a stock photo and I believe it is somewhere in Thailand and of course
                it was free. It helps fill in some space, plus it's so beautiful to look at.</p

    <p>This is only the second website that I have ever created. I have avoided the use 
        of predesigned templates. Everything you see here is very basic HTml and CSS code. 
        I am also exploring the use of Javascript and Python. All of the software that I 
        use is Free and Open Source. My operating systems and servers are primarily Ubuntu 
        Linux. If you are someone who has yet to create a website or is in the process of
        learning, you are more than welcome to check out my source code -- I believe it to
        be very flexible and adaptable and built on sound principles. If you are a coding 
        veteran, I would appreciate hearing your comments and suggestions to help improve 
        what I am working on.</p>
    
    <P>Getting back to the subject of Freedom, I thought that building this website might 
        lead me towards digital independence as much as that is possible. How can any of us 
        be truly independent when there are the Googles, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, SpaceX and 
        other giants that more or less own and control the system. No one really owns the 
        internet, but only a very few control access to it. How is this possible and how can 
        it be changed so that everyone has equal access to the source. This is what I want to 
        know. Maybe you can help me understand how everything has gotten so out of balance. 
        Can any of this be changed? If you know more than I do, I want to hear from you.</P>

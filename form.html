    <p>Life is an adventure. Look around you and try not to miss more than you have to.
        I have found that most of the stuff we really should be paying attention to are 
        the things we often ignore. There are great tools for learning such as Utube,
        and Wikipedia, but I find the process rather superficial because it is sort of
        like talking to a robot over the phone. There is no real life interaction. You 
        are only going to be handed a fixed set of information that never changes. Life 
        should not be a fixed set of rules, I don't care how golden they might be. We are 
        analog creatures and we are not ment to live by rules.</p>
        
    <p>Artificial intelegence is a rediculous label. Artificial only means artificial, 
        not intelegence. It is more like artificially collected data. So why are so many
        people advocating AI? I believe those people are lost in the "Matrix," and are a 
        danger to all of humanity. These are the type of people who care more about the 
        things they own and control than the world around them. If you are a fan of AI 
        please leave a comment below and tell me what it is that I am missing. Be as 
        critical as you want. I embrace criticism.</p>
